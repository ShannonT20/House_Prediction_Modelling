# Olusola Insurance Building Insurance Prediction

## Overview

This project is part of the Data Science Nigeria 2019 Bootcamp hosted on the Zindi platform. The goal is to address the increasing number of building collapses in Lagos and major cities in Nigeria. Olusola Insurance Company offers a building insurance policy covering damages caused by fire, vandalism, flood, or storm.

As the Lead Data Analyst, your task is to build a predictive model to determine if a building will have an insurance claim during a certain period. The goal is to predict the probability of having at least one claim over the insured period of the building.

The model will be based on building characteristics. The target variable, "Claim," is defined as follows:

- 1: The building has at least one claim over the insured period.
- 0: The building doesn't have a claim over the insured period.
